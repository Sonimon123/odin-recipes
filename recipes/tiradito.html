        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of the many joys of Peruvian cuisine is the beautiful way in which it has melded with the foods of immigrants. Nikkei cooking, for example, is Japanese-Peruvian food, the result of a 19th century influx of Japanese migrants to Peru. Peruvian food has influenced the way Japanese food is cooked there, and Japanese food has changed how Peruvians cook. The results are damn delicious.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                8 ounces (225g) frozen ají amarillo peppers (about 6 peppers) or 1/2 cup (120ml) ají amarillo paste (see note)
            </li>
            <li>
                6 ounces (170g) sashimi-grade fish, such as salmon, yellowtail (hamachi), fluke, or corvina
            </li>
            <li>
                3/4 cup (180ml) fresh lime juice from about 10 limes
            </li>
            <li>
                2 medium cloves garlic
            </li>
            <li>
                One 1-inch knob peeled fresh ginger (about 1/3 ounce; 10g)
            </li>
            <li>
                Kosher salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon minced fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems
            </li>
            <li>
                Choclo and/or cooked and peeled sweet potato rounds, for garnish (optional; see note)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>If using frozen ají amarillo chiles:</strong> In a medium pot, cover chiles with water (they will float) and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, stirring pot from time to time to rotate peppers. Remove from heat and drain. Allow to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, using a sharp slicing knife, slice fish into thin slabs. Arrange slices on plates and transfer to refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a blender, combine lime juice with garlic and ginger and blend on high speed until garlic and ginger are fully processed. Transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Rinse blender jar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove and discard seeds and stems from chile peppers. Strip off as much of the chile skin as you can and discard it. Transfer chile flesh to blender jar and blend at high speed, adding only enough water to get things moving, until a smooth purée forms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir 1/2 cup (120ml) ají amarillo paste into the lime juice until thoroughly combined. (You can add less or more chile paste to your taste, but keep in mind that in addition to heat and flavor, it also gives the sauce viscosity. If you add too little, the sauce will be very thin.) Season with salt. Reserve remaining ají amarillo paste for another use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in cilantro. Remove plates from refrigerator and spoon sauce on top of fish, lightly coating it (reserve any remaining sauce for another use). If desired, garnish plates with choclo and/or sweet potato. Serve right away.
